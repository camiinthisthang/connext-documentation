# Quickstart

:::info

This quickstart will teach you how to use `xcall`, the cross-chain communication primitive, to send funds and data across chains.

:::
---

In this guide, we will build a cross-chain Greeter. The `DestinationGreeting` contract on the destination domain (Mumbai) stores a greeting variable that we want to update. The `SourceGreeting` contract on the origin domain (Goerli) will use `xcall` to execute the updating function on `DestinationGreeting`.

## Prerequisites 

- Node v18 installed

Follow these instructions to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/) and use **Node.js v16**. We also recommend installing `nvm`, a node version manager, which will make switching versions easier.

- An Ethereum development environment like Foundry, Hardhat, Truffle, etc. This guide will be using Hardhat.

Follow these instructions to install [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview).

You'll need to manually install the library `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`
```bash npm2yarn
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable 
```

Install `dotenv` to protect your private key needed to deploy your contract:
```bash npm2yarn
npm install dotenv
```

In the root of your project, create a new file `.env.` Here you will store your private key used to deploy your contract.

Update your .env file to only have the following line:

```console
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY-HERE
```

## Source Contract

The source contract initiates the cross-chain operation with `xcall` and passes the encoded greeting into the call. All `xcall` params are detailed [here](./reference/contracts/calls#xcall).

Notice the token that is passed in is the TEST token on Goerli. You can read more about token flavors and why they matter [here](./reference/faq#what-are-token-flavors).

Note that in this contract, we're defining a constructor that takes in the address of the deployed Connext diamond contract on the same chain that this contract will be deployed to. Find the list of all Connext diamond contracts [here](https://docs.connext.network/resources/deployments).

  function updateGreeting (
    address target,

    uint256 relayerFee
  ) external {
    require(
      token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= cost,
      "User must approve amount"
    );

    // User sends funds to this contract

    bytes memory callData = abi.encode(newGreeting);

    connext.xcall{value: relayerFee}(
      destinationDomain, // _destination: Domain ID of the destination chain
      target,            // _to: address of the target contract

      callData           // _callData: the encoded calldata to send
    );
  }
}
```

### Compile Contract

Compile the contract with the following command: 
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

>Note: Hardhat may require you to manually install dependencies for @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox. If you get an error about missing dependencies for that plugin, run the follwing command: 
```bash
npm install --save-dev "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers@^1.0.0" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers@^1.0.0" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@^2.0.0" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan@^3.0.0" "@types/chai@^4.2.0" "@types/mocha@^9.1.0" "@typechain/ethers-v5@^10.1.0" "@typechain/hardhat@^6.1.2" "solidity-coverage@^0.8.1" "ts-node@>=8.0.0" "typescript@>=4.5.0"
```

To deploy your contract, update your `hardhat.config` file:
```js
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require('@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades');
// Any file that has require('dotenv').config() statement 
// will automatically load any variables in the root's .env file.
require('dotenv').config();
 
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.17",
  networks:{
    goerli:{
      url: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_goerli",
     // PRIVATE_KEY loaded from .env file
      accounts: [`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    }
  }
};
```

### Deploy Contract

Update your `deploy.js` file, found under scripts, with the following: 
```js
const main = async () => {
  const SourceGreeting = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('SourceGreeting');
  const sourceGreetingContract = await SourceGreeting.deploy("0x0C70d6E9760DEE639aC761f3564a190220DF5E44");
  await sourceGreetingContract.deployed();
  console.log("Contract deployed to:", sourceGreetingContract.address);
  
};

const runMain = async () => {
  try {
    await main();
    process.exit(0);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

runMain();
```

Then call the deploy script: 
```bash
$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
Contract deployed to: 0x8CC1DB2a76ea4bc40089f0Db2B25f8B13032F72d
```

Note the contract address because you'll want to verify your contracts later.

## Target Contract

Follow the same steps above to create a new hardhat project, this time name the project `DestinationGreeting.` Install all the same dependencies as above. 

All target contracts must implement Connext's `IXReceiver` interface. This interface ensures that Connext can call the contract and pass necessary data. 

```solidity showLineNumbers
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

import {IXReceiver} from "@connext/nxtp-contracts/contracts/core/connext/interfaces/IXReceiver.sol";
import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract DestinationGreeting is IXReceiver {
  string public greeting;

  // Hardcoded cost to update the greeting, in wei units
  uint256 public cost = 1e18;

  // The TEST Token on Mumbai
  IERC20 public token = IERC20(0xeDb95D8037f769B72AAab41deeC92903A98C9E16);

  /** @notice The receiver function as required by the IXReceiver interface.
    * @dev The Connext bridge contract will call this function.
    */
  function xReceive(
    bytes32 _transferId,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _asset,
    address _originSender,
    uint32 _origin,
    bytes memory _callData
  ) external returns (bytes memory) {
    // Enforce the cost to update the greeting
    require(
      _asset == address(token) && _amount >= cost,
      "Must pay at least 1 TEST"
    );

    // Unpack the _callData
    string memory newGreeting = abi.decode(_callData, (string));

    _updateGreeting(newGreeting);
  }

  /** @notice Internal function to update the greeting.
    * @param newGreeting The new greeting.
    */
  function _updateGreeting(string memory newGreeting) internal {
    greeting = newGreeting;
  }
}
```

With this code, you'll be able to update the greeting from the source contract.

## Executing the Transaction

Now that you've deployed your contracts, let's verify that we're actually able to access the source contract's functionality from the destination contract.

If you don't already have gas funds on Goerli, try these faucets to get some:
- https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/ (Requires Twitter account)
- https://goerlifaucet.com/ (Requires signing up with Alchemy)

For the following steps, you should try deploying (and verifying) your own contracts. For ease, you can use the contracts we deployed for this part:
>Note: These contracts are named differently than the ones you just wrote, but the content of the contract is the same. 
- [`HelloSource.sol`](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x9ce3799f033d89d316f373f1db161c84a401a26c) 
- [`HelloTarget.sol`](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x9094da44ec4335632c28749437f616a8a6cadcb6) 

### TEST Token Minting

Mint some TEST tokens that will be used for this example. 

You can use Etherscan to call functions on (verified) contracts. Go to the [TEST Token on Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x7ea6eA49B0b0Ae9c5db7907d139D9Cd3439862a1#writeContract) and click on the "Write Contract" button.

<img src="/img/quickstart/write_contract_etherscan.png" alt="write_contract"/>

A new tab will show up with all write functions of the contract. Connect your wallet, switch to the Goerli network, and enter the parameters for the `mint` function:

- `account`: <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>
- `amount`: 10000000000000000000 (10 TEST)

### TEST Token Spending Approval

Tokens will move from `User's wallet` => `SourceGreeting` => `Connext` => `DestinationGreeting`.

The user must first approve a spending allowance of the TEST ERC20 to the `SourceGreeting` contract. The `require` clause starting on line 37 checks for this allowance. 

Again, on the Etherscan page, enter the parameters for the `approve` function:
- `spender`: 0x9ce3799f033d89d316f373f1db161c84a401a26c
  - This is the address of `SourceGreeting`.
- `amount`: 10000000000000000000 (10 TEST)
  - Recall that `DestinationGreeting` requires a payment of at least 1 TEST (1e18 wei units). In `SourceGreeting`, this is hardcoded as 1000500300000000000 to account for a 0.05% fee that routers will take on the bridged asset. But you can approve as much as you want. This way, you can call `updateGreeting` without having to do an approval every time.
  - If earning fees as a router sounds interesting, check out the [Routers](../routers/routers-intro) documentation.

<img src="/img/quickstart/TEST_Etherscan_approve.png" alt="TestERC20 Etherscan Approve"/>

Then "Write" to the `approve` function.

### Execute `updateGreeting`

Similarly to the approval function for TEST, navigate to the `HelloSource` contract on Etherscan. Fill out the `updateGreeting` function parameters and "Write" to the contract.

<img src="/img/quickstart/updateGreeting.png" alt="TestERC20 Etherscan Approve"/>

Let's talk about the different parameters.
- `target`: 0x9094da44ec4335632c28749437f616a8a6cadcb6
  - The address of `DestinationGreeting`.
- `destinationDomain`: 9991
  - The Domain ID of the destination chain. You can find a mapping of [Domain IDs here](../resources/supported-chains). Remember, `DestinationGreeting` is deployed to Mumbai.
- `newGreeting`: hello chain!
  - Whatever string you want to update the greeting to.
- `relayerFee`: 0
  - **IMPORTANT!** This is a fee paid to relayers, which are off-chain agents that help execute the final leg of the cross-chain transfer on the destination. Relayers get paid in the origin chain's native asset. This is why `SourceGreeting` passes the fee like so:

    ```solidity
    connext.xcall{value: relayerFee}(...)
    ```

    However, we're paying 0 fees here! Only because on testnet, our relayers are not taking fees.

    :::note
    As a xApp developer, you have some tools available to estimate what this `relayerFee` should be. Check out the guide on [Estimating Fees](./guides/estimating-fees).
    :::

### Check `DestinationGreeting`

After executing `updateGreeting`, `DestinationGreeting` should be updated in just a few minutes. 
- Would it always be this fast? See our guide on [Authentication](./guides/authentication) to learn when `xcall` is fast or slow.

Head over to the `DestinationGreeting` contract on Etherscan. This time, we'll go to the `Read Contract` tab and look at the value of `greeting`. It has updated!

<img src="/img/quickstart/read_greeting.png" alt="TestERC20 Etherscan Approve"/>

Send a couple more updates from `HelloSource` but make it a different string. At some point, your TEST allowance to `HelloSource` will run out and you'll need to do the approval dance again.

Congrats! You've gone cross-chain!

---

## Next Steps

- Try [tracking the status](./guides/xcall-status) of an `xcall` after you send it.
- Learn about [authentication](./guides/authentication) and important security considerations.
- See how [nested xcalls](./guides/nested-xcalls) can open up infinite cross-chain possibilities.
- Fork the xApp Starter Kit below (includes code for this example) and build your own xApp.
